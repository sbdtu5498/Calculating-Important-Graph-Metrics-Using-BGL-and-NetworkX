# Calculating Important Graph Metrics Using Boost Graph Library and NetworkX
This project represent demonstrations to aid my GSoC 2022 proposal for pgRouting, an OSGeo Community Project. Demonstrations in this projects are used to show how boost graph library can be used to calculate various important graph metrics such as vertex betweenness centrality, edge betweenness centrality, central point dominance, bandwidth and ith-bandwidth. In order to run C++ codes install boost graph library and GNU C++ Compiler in your local environment. In order to run IPython Notebook in your local environment, install Python3, NetworkX and PyGraphViz.
