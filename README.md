# Calculating Important Graph Metrics Using Boost Graph Library and NetworkX
This project repository represents demonstrations to aid my [GSoC 2022 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8kEp_DSUA5g0pn-H14zxf8psc_wyo8H1VmgtkoPUfk/edit#) for pgRouting, an OSGeo Community Project. Demonstrations in this projects are used to show how boost graph library can be used to calculate various important graph metrics such as vertex betweenness centrality, edge betweenness centrality, central point dominance, bandwidth and ith-bandwidth. Further, in order to validate the answers and provide illustrations I have used Jupyter Notebooks along with various Python libraries such as NetworkX and PyGraphviz. In order to run C++ codes install boost graph library and C++ Compiler in your local environment. In order to run Jupyter Notebooks in your local environment, install Python, NetworkX and PyGraphviz.
