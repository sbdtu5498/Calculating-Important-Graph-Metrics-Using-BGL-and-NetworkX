# Calculating Important Graph Metrics Using BGL and NetworkX
This project represent demonstrations to aid my GSoC 2022 proposal for pgRouting, an OSGeo Community Project. Demonstrations in this projects are used to show how boost graph library can be used to calculate various important graph metrics such as vertex betweenness centrality, edge betweenness centrality, central point dominance, bandwidth and ith-bandwidth.
